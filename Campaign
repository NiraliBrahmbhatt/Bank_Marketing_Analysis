Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis
📖 Project Background
This project focuses on analyzing a large-scale bank marketing dataset to understand customer behavior and optimize future outreach. The goal was to move beyond static reporting and create a dynamic tool that identifies the "Who" and "When" of successful subscriptions.

🛠️ Technical Workflow
1. Data Transformation (Power Query)
The raw data required significant structural work before it was ready for analysis.

Data Auditing: Identified and handled missing/unknown values across categorical columns (Job, Education, Housing).

Standardization: Cleaned inconsistent naming conventions and ensured data type integrity.

Schema Design: Optimized the dataset structure for high-performance cross-filtering within Power BI.

2. Analytical Modeling (DAX)
Created a series of measures to provide real-time insights:

Total Records: The full scope of the outreach campaign.

Conversion Rate: Dynamic calculation of "Yes" vs "No" responses.

Trend Analysis: Measures focused on identifying monthly peaks and troughs.

3. Data Visualization
Designed a user-centric dashboard that allows stakeholders to:

Filter by Job Category and Education Level to see demographic trends.

Visualize the Subscription Funnel to identify drop-off points.

Track Monthly Performance to pinpoint peak marketing windows.

💡 Key Business Insights
The "May" Effect: Outreach efforts peaked in May, showing a significantly higher engagement rate than the Q3 and Q4 quarters.

Primary Segments: Administrative and Technical roles emerged as the most consistent and high-volume subscriber groups.<img width="1920" height="1096" alt="Screenshot (390)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f41c514-4e66-4425-976b-a578239a4068" />
